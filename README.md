# coop-re7: online co-op for Resident Evil 7 (prototype, v0.22)

Play Resident Evil 7 with a friend over the internet. Each of you sees the other as a full-body character (Ethan,
or anyone you pick in the Lobby) who walks, jogs, crouches, sidesteps, looks around, blocks and acts where they do,
over Steam (no port forwarding).

> **Prototype.** The first real two-player session (2026-11-02) got from the start of the game to the first
> save point after Chapter 3: connecting, seeing each other, fighting Mia together and reviving worked. Much of
> what it found is fixed in this version but hasn't had a second session yet.
> [TWO-PLAYER-TEST.md](TWO-PLAYER-TEST.md) is a checklist for one.

## What's shared

| | |
|---|---|
| **Each other** | Position, movement, crouching, looking around, footsteps, which chapter you're in, and the moves RE7 plays on your body (blocking, weapon swings, both hands, the weapon held up while walking, climbing, getting hit, touching doors). A downed friend lies on the floor. Their weapon or the item they're using in hand. A marker with the distance, pointing the way when they're off screen. How you look: pick a character in the **Lobby**. |
| **Enemies** (early) | Each enemy is run by the game of the player nearest to it and follows along in the other game; it changes hands when the other player gets clearly closer, and when one of you pauses. Damage and deaths count in both games, and your friend's hits make the enemy flinch (experimental). **Bosses** (Jack's garage car fight and later, found by story progress) run in each game on their own, with shared damage and defeat. |
| **Doors, drawers, boxes, interactions** | A door unlocked, opened or closed in one game does the same in the other. Drawers open and shut for both; a breakable box smashed by one disappears for the other (no pieces), and each of you gets its item. One-off interactions (the fridge, the van, the pot, switches) happen in both games (experimental). |
| **Supplies** | Each player gets their own ammo, healing and crafting materials. For a harder game, tick **Share supplies** (one setting for both of you): then there's one copy, and whatever one player picks up disappears for the other. Weapons, keys, files and maps always stay for both, so nobody gets stuck; when one of you takes one, the other is told to pick it up too. |
| **Story** (experimental, off by default) | With **Share story** ticked, a cutscene or one of Jack's scripted moments that one of you starts also plays for the other when you're close together (same chapter, about 12 m). **VHS tapes:** when your friend puts one in, you follow them into it. |
| **Deaths** | With your friend connected, a fatal hit puts you **down** instead of a game over, until your friend stands next to you for 3 seconds. |
| **Pausing** | The other player sees "Your friend paused the game"; enemies your game was running carry on in theirs. |
| **Saving** | Each player saves their own game; when one saves, the other is told, so you can both save at the same point. |
| **Pushed objects** (experimental) | Chairs, bottles and other loose props one of you knocks around move for the other too. |
| **Catching up** | Each game keeps a list of the lasting changes it made (doors unlocked, boxes smashed, drawers, switches, supplies taken, Molded killed) for 12 hours. When your friend joins or rejoins, the list is sent and their game catches up, including what you did while they were away. |
| **Talking** | Quick messages with **F5** (ping: "Over here"), **F6** (Come here), **F7** (Wait for me) and **F8** (Help!): your friend sees them at the top of the screen, and a marker for pings, Come here and Help. Each other's **health** shows on the status line and nameplate. |
| Not shared | Item boxes, puzzles, weapon sounds. |

## Install (both players)

1. Have **Resident Evil 7 biohazard on Steam**, fully updated.
2. Download the latest release zip from the **Releases** page and unzip it anywhere.
3. Double-click **Install.cmd**. It will:
   - find RE7 in your Steam libraries and **copy it** to `Documents\RE7-coop` (or `C:\RE7-coop` when your
     Documents folder is synced by OneDrive). Your normal install is not changed; the copy needs as much free
     space as your RE7 install;
   - download **REFramework** and its C# add-on from the official release and **check each file's SHA-256**;
   - install the co-op files, back up your saves, and put a **Start RE7 Co-op** shortcut on your desktop.
4. If the installer says **.NET 10 runtime not found**, install ".NET Runtime 10" (Windows x64) from
   https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0 and run Install.cmd again.

Updating: unzip the new version and run Install.cmd again. It reuses your co-op folder, keeps your settings and
your friend, and replaces only the mod files. **Both players need the same version.**

### Optional: full character models

RE7's own full-body player models are incomplete (no real face). For complete characters in the Lobby, each
player can add the Nexus mod **Third Person Full Model Placeholders** (RE7 mod 86, by AfroJackX):

1. Download its **RT** main file from Nexus into your **Downloads** folder (no need to unzip it).
2. With the game closed, double-click **Use full models.cmd** (in this download). It finds the download, copies
   the models into a folder only the co-op mod reads (so your own first-person view stays normal), and switches
   on REFramework's Loose File Loader.

The Lobby then says "Full character models: installed".

## Play

1. Start Steam, then **Start RE7 Co-op** (desktop shortcut), and load a save. **Never played RE7?** Start a
   **New Game** and play through the opening drive until you can walk around before connecting; joining
   from the very first screen (no save yet) leaves the screen black. If the game asks to create save data,
   tick **Allow saving** in the RE7 Co-op window (Insert) first, then answer Yes.
2. Press **Insert**. A **RE7 Co-op** window opens next to the REFramework menu. Expand
   **Connect and saving**. **No Insert key** (many laptops)? See *No Insert key* below.
3. Under *Your Steam friends in RE7 Co-op*, click **Connect** next to your friend's name. (They appear there
   once they've started RE7 Co-op too.)
4. Your friend sees "*<your name>* invited you to co-op" at the top left of their screen. They press Insert and
   click **Accept**.
5. The top-left corner shows **Co-op: connected to <name> - <ping> ms**, and they appear with their name over
   their head.
6. Open **Lobby** to pick how you look to your friend (Ethan, Mia, Mia (ship), Clancy, Zoe, Chris, Joe).
7. Use **F5-F8** to send quick messages (see *Talk and catch up* below).

Your friend is remembered, so next time it reconnects by itself. Connecting by SteamID still works, under
**Connect with a SteamID instead**.

**Meeting up.** If your friend is in another chapter, click **Go to my friend's chapter** (Lobby, or Connect):
you start at the beginning of their chapter, then walk to each other. Nothing from the jump is saved (saving is
switched off first). **Teleport to my friend** works once you're within 40 m of them.

### No Insert key

REFramework opens and closes its menu (and the RE7 Co-op window with it) with Insert only. Without that key the
menu stays on screen, with an extra mouse pointer. Give it another key once: click the REFramework window's title
bar to expand it, open **Configuration**, click **Menu Key** and press a key the game doesn't use, for example
**F9** (F5-F8 are the quick messages). Tick **Remember Menu State** there too, so the menu stays closed when the game
starts. Wherever this guide says Insert, use that key.

### The RE7 Co-op window

Press **Insert**; the window opens next to the REFramework menu. Its sections:

| Section | What's in it |
|---|---|
| **Lobby** | Both players, their chapters, and **You appear to your friend as**: Default (whoever you're playing), Ethan, Mia, Mia (ship), Clancy, Zoe, Chris, Joe. Without the full-model mod some lack a face. |
| **Talk and catch up** | Quick-message buttons (the same as F5-F8, plus "Go on ahead"), a switch for the F5-F8 keys, your catch-up list, **Catch up now** (both ways, if something looks out of step), and **Start a fresh list** (when you start a new game together; you're reminded if your list has changes from a later chapter than your friend's). |
| **Connect and saving** | Your Steam friends in RE7 Co-op (**Connect**, **Accept**), **Show all online friends**, connecting by SteamID, **Allow saving** and **Back up saves now**. |
| **Options** | What's shown and what's shared (below). |
| **Help** | **Go to my friend's chapter**, **Teleport to my friend**, **Fast-forward this cutscene**, **Fix my friend's character**, **Reload last save**, **Make a bug report**. |
| **Show developer tools** | Off by default: the test bot and research tools (below). |

**Saving.** **Allow saving** is off by default: nothing you do is saved. Turn it on to save normally. Your save folder is
backed up automatically (at every launch and when you turn this on; the last 20 backups are kept in
`reframework\data\save_backups`). The co-op copy shares Steam Cloud saves with your normal RE7. When one of you saves,
the other sees "Your friend saved" so you can both save at the same point.

**Options:**

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **On-screen status** | The top-left status lines (connection, ping, chapter, your friend's health, the last quick message, saving, what your friend just did). |
| **Nameplate over your friend** | Their Steam name, health and distance above their character; when they're off screen, a pointer at the screen edge. |
| **Friend's footsteps** | Hear your friend's footsteps where they walk (walk, jog and crouch sounds). |
| **Share story (cutscenes and progress, experimental; same for both)** | Off by default. One setting for both: when either of you ticks or unticks it, it changes for the other too. When ticked, a story cutscene your friend reaches also plays for you, but only if you're in the same chapter and within about 12 m of them; otherwise you see it yourself when you get there. Story progress is copied only right after a cutscene you watched together, so a player who's behind is never pushed ahead. |
| **Show your friend's weapon** | On by default. The weapon or item your friend holds appears in their character's hand. |
| **Heal my friend** (experimental) | Off by default. Use a healing item while standing next to your friend (within about 2.5 m) and it heals them instead of you. |
| **Hide my friend on ladders** | On by default. RE7 has no climbing animation for the body, so your friend's character disappears while they climb and comes back at the top. |
| **Follow my friend into VHS tapes** | On by default. When your friend goes from your chapter into a tape, your game jumps into it after them a few seconds later (saving is switched off first). Never back out: finish the tape. |
| **Share interactions** (experimental) | On by default; one setting for both players. One-off interactions and switches one of you uses happen in the other game too (never saving, tapes or item boxes). Turn off if one ever does something odd. |
| **Share pushed objects** (experimental) | On by default; one setting for both players. Loose props one of you moves are moved in the other game too. |
| **Share phone calls** | On by default; one setting for both players. When one of you answers a phone, the other's phone is answered too (also when they get there later). Turn off if a call ever starts at a bad moment. |
| **Share supplies** | Off by default: each of you gets your own ammo and healing. One setting for both, like Share story. Tick it for a harder game with one copy for both: what one picks up disappears for the other. |

**Help:**

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Go to my friend's chapter** | Shown when you're in different chapters: jump to the start of theirs. Saving is switched off first. |
| **Teleport to my friend** | Hop to them when you're within 40 m (same chapter). Further away, walk: RE7 only loads the area around you. |
| **Fast-forward this cutscene** | Runs the game 8x while the cutscene plays (nothing is skipped, it's just quicker). |
| **Fix my friend's character** | Rebuilds your friend's character if it looks broken (T-pose, sliding, missing). |
| **Reload last save** | What Continue does. Not after a chapter jump: restart the game instead. |
| **Make a bug report** | Puts a zip of the co-op logs on your desktop, with SteamIDs, Steam names and your Windows user name blanked out, ready to send. |

**Developer tools** (tick **Show developer tools**; for trying things alone):

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Test with bot** | A fake player. **Follow me**: it walks the path you walked and waits near you (and can revive you). **Walk in a circle**: it cycles every stance and direction. **Stay here**: it stands still. **Dress the bot as** tries each character on it. |
| **Bot: ...** buttons | The bot "does" what a friend would: take down or hit the nearest enemy, open or unlock the nearest door, smash the nearest box, open or shut the nearest drawer, take the nearest supply, trigger the next story cutscene, pretend to be in another chapter. |
| **Take a fatal hit** | Go down on purpose (the bot revives you). |
| **Fast-forward every cutscene** | Like the Help button, for every cutscene. |
| **Chapter switcher** | Jump straight to any chapter. Only targets ending in `_Start` load into gameplay; saving is switched off first. |
| Research tools | Record and replay an enemy, hand an enemy to the bot, a reload test, and the ghost debug panel (REFramework menu, Script Generated UI). |

## Known limits

- **One real two-player session so far.** Fixes since then (enemy hand-offs, doors closing, boxes, drawers,
  pausing, the Lobby, blocking, the story rework, everything new in v0.13) were tested alone or with the bot only.
- **Animations:** your friend's character copies the moves RE7 plays on their body. Knife swings are tested (with
  the bot, slightly choppy); other weapons use the same path but are untested. Scripted moments played by other actors (phone calls, the leg
  scene) aren't shown. In VHS tapes the character may slide instead of walking.
- **Characters:** Mia (non-ship) has a gap on her left side and dark eyes, even with the full-model mod. Joe's
  hands are found by trying likely file names; he may still have none.
- **Enemies:** an enemy runs on one player's game and mostly goes after that player. Flinching from your
  friend's hits is a first attempt. Jack's scripted moments (smashing through a wall) happen in each game
  on its own.
- **Story:** keys and story items are picked up by each player separately (you're told when your friend takes
  one), because some scripted events follow that player's own pickup. If a cutscene ever hangs and you can't
  move, restart the game and load again (with saving off, nothing is lost).
- **Interactions** are shared by running the game's own "done" step in the other game; it may not show the
  animation, and puzzles aren't included.
- **Deaths:** going down has no fall animation (you crouch). "Both down" and the 90-second limit are untested.
- **Item boxes** are separate per player.
- Tested on RE7's current (ray-tracing) version. The older non-RT version (Steam beta `dx11_non-rt`) should
  work but hasn't been tried; the installer tells you if you're on it.
- The chapter jump is a hidden developer feature of RE7: after many jumps in one session it can break (black
  screen, outside the map). Restart the game if that happens.

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | Try |
|---|---|
| Your friend isn't in the list | They need RE7 Co-op running and to be your Steam friend; or tick **Show all online friends** |
| "Waiting for your friend" | They need to click **Accept** (or **Connect** on you) |
| "Friend's packets don't match" | You're on different coop-re7 versions; both install the same release |
| "Friend is in another chapter" | Click **Go to my friend's chapter** |
| Their label moves but no body | Wait a few seconds, or press **Fix my friend's character** (Help) |
| Stuck after a cutscene, can't move | Restart the game and load again |
| Black screen or outside the map after chapter jumps | Restart the game |
| Black screen but you can move, on a brand-new game | Start a **New Game** alone, play the opening until you can walk, then connect |
| "Create save data?" keeps coming back | Insert, tick **Allow saving**, then Yes |
| An extra mouse pointer on screen | The REFramework menu is open: close it with Insert (or your menu key, see *No Insert key*) |
| Pause menu won't open | Wait 5 seconds out of any cutscene (the mod clears a stuck video flag), or restart |
| You see the inside of a head in first person | The full-model mod's files are in place but not set up: close the game and run **Use full models.cmd** |

For a bug report, click **Make a bug report** (RE7 Co-op window) and send the zip it puts on your desktop. The logs
are in your co-op folder's `reframework\data`: `coop_dummy_log.txt`,
`coop_enemies_log.txt`, `coop_world_log.txt`, `coop_story_log.txt`, `coop_revive_log.txt` and
`coopnet_status.txt`. `coopnet_status.txt` contains your SteamID and Steam name; remove them before posting
publicly (the bug-report zip does this for you).

## How it works

REFramework Lua scripts build the other player from the full-body "shadow" model RE7 keeps for the player
(it renders it only for the player's shadow), or from the character picked in the Lobby, and animate it with
Ethan's own animations, including the upper-body moves your body plays (blocking). A C# plugin sends 30 small
updates a second over Steam's relay network (`ISteamNetworkingMessages`), plus guaranteed messages for things
that happen once (a kill, a door, a pickup, a cutscene) and 10-a-second enemy updates. The scripts:

| Script | Does |
|---|---|
| `coop_dummy.lua` | Your friend's character, the Lobby, connecting, the RE7 Co-op window, on-screen status, footsteps |
| `coop_enemies.lua` | Shared enemy damage, deaths and movement (who runs each enemy), pausing |
| `coop_world.lua` | Shared doors, drawers, breakable boxes and supplies |
| `coop_talk.lua` | The catch-up list, quick messages, pings and health |
| `coop_story.lua` | Shared story cutscenes and progress; "your friend saved" |
| `coop_revive.lua` | Downed and revive |
| `coop_saveguard.lua` | Blocks saving unless you allow it |
| `CoopNet.cs` | The network plugin (Steam relay, bot, save backups, bug reports) |

Details and everything learned along the way are in [docs/NOTES.md](docs/NOTES.md) and the coop-anything
write-up `games/resident-evil-7`.
